Logstash Configs 
=================

These are some different log parsing configs i've used to parse logs on various client engagements. It's not uncommon to be passed some logs and say, "here, find evil". If only there wasn't 50GB+ of logs it wouldn't be so bad. That's where logstash comes into play.
